> *This package allows you to install a Mautrix-WhatsApp bridge quickly and simply on a YunoHost server alongside Matrix-Synapse.  
If you don't have YunoHost, please see [here](https://yunohost.org/#/install) to know how to install and enjoy it.*

## Overview
A puppeting bridge between Matrix and WhatsApp packaged as a YunoHost service. Messages, media and notifications are bridged between a whatsapp user and a matrix user. The matrix user can invite other matrix user in a bridged whatsapp room, such that even people without a whatsapp account can participate to whatsapp group conversations. The ["mautrix-whatsapp"](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki) bridge consists in a synapse app service and relies on postgresql (mysql also available). Therefore, [Synapse for YunoHost](https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/synapse_ynh) should be installed beforehand.

**Shipped version:** 1.0

## Demo

* If you want to test the bridge, send an email to the App maintainer with the matrix user account you want to bridge to WhatsApp.

## Bridging usage
### Bridge a WhatsApp user and a Matrix user
* First your matrix user or server has to be authorized in the bridge configuration (see below)
* Then, invite the bot (default @whatsappbot:yoursynapse.domain) in this new matrix-whatsapp bot administration room.
* Type ``login``
* Capture the QR code with the camera in the whatsapp of your VM or smartphone (WhatsApp Web)
* Send ``help`` to the bot in the created room to know how to control the bot.
See also [upstream wiki Authentication page](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki/Authentication)

** Note that several WhatsApp and Matrix users can be bridge, each users has its own bot administration room. If they are in a same WhatsApp group, only one matrix room will be created. **

### Bridge a WhatsApp group in Matrix "Relaybot"
* First Relaybot option should be enabled in the bridge configuration (default=disabled, see below) 
* Once the bot administration room is setup, you can also bridge all messages between a Matrix room and a WhatsApp room/group. 
In whatsapp all messages will be sent by the account who is logged in with a prefix for the source matrix user. On the matrix side the bridge will still create matrix users corresponding to the whatsapp users when they send a message.

## Configuration of the bridge

The bridge is roughly configured at installation, e.g. allowed admin and user of the bot. Finer configuration can be done by modifying the
following configuration file with SSH: 
```/opt/yunohost/mautrix_whatsapp/config.yaml```
and then restarting the mautrix_whatsapp service.

## Documentation

 * Official "mautrix-whatsapp" documentation: https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki
 * Matrix room: #whatsapp:maunium.net
In case you need to upload your logs somewhere, be aware that they contain your contacts' and your phone numbers. Strip them out with 
``| sed -r 's/[0-9]{10,}/ðŸ“ž/g' ``
 * "mautrix-whatsapp" bridge is based on the [Rhymen/go-whatsapp](https://github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp) implementation of the [sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng) project.
 * YunoHost documentation: If specific documentation is needed, feel free to contribute.

## YunoHost specific features

#### Multi-users support

* Bot users are not related to Yunohost users. Any matrix account or server autorized in the configuration of the bridge can use the bot. 
* The whatsapp bot is a local matrix-synapse user, but accessible through federation (synapse public or private).
* Several WhatsApp and Matrix users can be bridged with one bridge, each user has its own bot administration room. 
* If several bot users are in a same WhatsApp group, only one matrix room will be created by the bridge.

Multi-instance installation should work, but was not tested yet. A priori it makes only sense if several synapse instances are installed.

#### Supported architectures

* Tested on ARMv7 in April 2020
* x86-64b - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/logs/mautrix-whatsapp_ynh%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps.yunohost.org/ci/apps/mautrix-whatsapp_ynh/)
* ARMv8-A - [![Build Status](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/logs/mautrix-whatsapp_ynh%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-apps-arm.yunohost.org/ci/apps/mautrix-whatsapp_ynh/)
* Jessie x86-64b - [![Build Status](https://ci-stretch.nohost.me/ci/logs/mautrix-whatsapp_ynh%20%28Apps%29.svg)](https://ci-stretch.nohost.me/ci/apps/mautrix-whatsapp_ynh/)

## Limitations

* Audio/Video calls are not bridged yet. 
* If whatsapp loses connection, e.g. the phone is set in flight mode or push notifications are deactivated, the bot has sometimes to be restarted manually by sending a reconnnect message in the matrix administration room.

## Additional information

* It is recommended to install whatsapp on a virtual android running on a server, see [upstream wiki Android-VM-Setup page](https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-whatsapp/wiki/Android-VM-Setup)

Please do your pull request to the testing branch.
To try the testing branch, please proceed like that:
```
sudo yunohost app install https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_whatsapp_ynh/tree/testing --debug
or
sudo yunohost app upgrade synapse -u https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/mautrix_whatsapp_ynh/tree/testing --debug
```

To test communication between the app service and synapse on a VM, you must install a certificate:
```
echo | openssl s_client -showcerts -servername synapse.vm -connect synapse.vm:443 2>/dev/null | awk '/-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----/, /-----END CERTIFICATE-----/' >> /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/synapse.vm.crt
update-ca-certificates
```
